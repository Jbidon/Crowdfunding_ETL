# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

1. Start by opening pgAdmin and open the "crowdfunding_db_schema.sql" file.
2. Run the "Drop Tables" section.
3. Run the "Create Tables" section.
4. Import the csv files into each of the tables, starting with "contacts", "category", "subcategory", then "campaign". (Make sure to import the "campaign" csv file last.)
5. Finally, you can check that the tables were imported correctly by running each line in the "Check Data Import" section individually.
